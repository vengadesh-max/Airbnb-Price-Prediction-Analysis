## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Upload Your Dataset**:

   - Place your Airbnb CSV in `data/raw/` folder
   - Ensure it has columns: price, rating, reviews, bathrooms, beds, guests, bedrooms, country, amenities

3. **Run the Web App**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Use the Notebooks**:
   - Open any notebook in Jupyter
   - Each has 8 comprehensive code blocks
   - Follow the analysis workflow

### Dataset Requirements

Your CSV should include:

- **Target**: `price` (numerical)
- **Features**: `rating`, `reviews`, `bathrooms`, `beds`, `guests`, `bedrooms`
- **Location**: `country`, `address`
- **Amenities**: `amenities`, `features`
- **Other**: `host_name`, `checkin`, `checkout`
